RIDE does check exits passed through for locks against
 your riders. If they are locked out, they fall off. If in your RIDE/
 directory, you @set me=ride/_ridercheck:YES
 then your riders will be checked just after you move to a new place,
 and if any are locked out, you will automatically be yoyo'ed back
 to the place you just left, and get a warning message.

Dagon's Tower(#139581R)
    This is a large circular room that looks to be part of a castle tower, the walls being dark stone, smooth with age. The ceiling is a slightly domed 15 feet, black stucco braced by huge, dark oak beams. Three archways spaced evenly around the room let light in through gauzy purple curtains blowing open in the gently crossbreeze. They lead out to stone railed balconies, looking /out/ over a forested landscape. Heavy wood doors stand open at the archways, and can be closed to keep out unwanted guests, weather, light, and by the size of them, small armies.
    A huge 4 post /bed/ sits on one of the balconies, taking up the archway almost completely. Beside the bed is a large four drawer oak /dresser/. Opposite the bed, the stone wall curves inwards to frame the huge /fireplace/, always crackling away with a large wood fire, warming the air and filling the tower with the smell of cedar and pine. The only other furniture is an old oak /desk/ against the wall beside the fireplace, with a big comfy chair. A matching /bookcase/ flanks the other side of the fireplace.
    To make the castle a bit cozier he has hung warm tapestries of wildlife posed in picturesque landscapes of trees and streams, purple curtains help cover more of the dark grey stone. A few of his favorite swords, spears, and bows remain, displayed nicely. An ornate wood sign up on a wall reads "Abandon all clothes, ye who enter here."
    Most of the room is carpeted by thick black carpeting so soft beneath toes and bodies. Near the archways and the fireplace the carpet lets the smooth stone floor show through. In the center of the floor is a private teleport pattern, purple stone runes cut through the carpet. Scattered around the room are black leather beanbag chairs of varying sizes; the only seating aside from the bed, and home to his three coffee tables: Xero the fluffy fox, Sola the sexy kitty, and Werel the not quite so fluffy as sir Xero, wuff. Hugging a wall are heavy oak steps leading up to the next floor and down to a basement.
(summary: Big round stone castle room, black carpet, big bed, big fireplace, beanbag chairs, 3 balconies, no doors)
