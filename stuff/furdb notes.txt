view modes:

checkboxes:
show groups / don't show groups
show offline furs / don't show offline furs

dropdown:
list, [small] icons, details




note that 'small icons' and 'details' use groups, but 'list' just dumps them all out as one
so when selecting 'list' there won't be distinction for offline furs
