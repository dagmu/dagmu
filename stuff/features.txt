C# WinForms

	done
multiple input boxes
mousewheel anywhere scrolls the main window
desc editor reads your list desc(s), no matter their name.


	bugs
p =, wh = don't work, InputBox.cs input_KeyDown
closing world does not close any helpers
last intercept makes newlines
multiline poses don't scroll to bottom correctly, only scrolls to start of line
when you open desc editor and something is unset, the box will remain greyed out: gender, species, scent, desc
richtextbox sees // as clickable link, override underlying win32 control with http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9196/Links-with-arbitrary-text-in-a-RichTextBox or disable DetectURL and parse manually
resize doesn't keep bottom line in view
console needs to start a bit wider
console needs to use richtextbox maybe, horizontal rezising is fucked
