	bug wishes
wrong connect command sends loggedin lines like exa me, causing welcome.txt to spam
p =, wh = don't work, InputBox.cs input_KeyDown
richtextbox sees // as clickable link, override underlying win32 control with http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9196/Links-with-arbitrary-text-in-a-RichTextBox or disable DetectURL and parse manually
console needs to start a bit wider
console needs to use richtextbox maybe, horizontal rezising is fucked

detect editplayer's looktrap (x looked at you), use for auto highlighting. won't work with looktraps built into desc.. custom highlighting would bypass the problem.
