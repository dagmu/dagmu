lesson: every 'connected' or 'reconnected' adds 1 to the person ('s quantity)
	every 'disconnected' removes 1
	if person = 0 then they're gone
	if person > 1 then they're probably online
	the only problem is if YOU connect in-between the 'connected' and 'reconnected', the person will be set to 1, and when the 'disconnected' rolls around the client will knock them off the list. a manual WF will put them back on though. this is fine because that's what you have to do anyway when that happens, and in the client there's a WF button for convenience.

'public'
string name	"Zuchter"	// taps character name
string group	"Horses"	// for sorting contacts, primarily for the WF display
string altof "Krahnos"	// this character is an alt of ____, should be grouped in the WF?
int timezone;	PST		// gmt offset factor
date birthday;			// for birthday reminders and age calculation
date whenmet;			// when did you meet this fur
string notes;	"real name is Jason Saunders"
string notes; // optional misc notes saved in the database 'private'
integer quantity; 1		// how many of this character is online, a simple boolean is not sufficient
