 Tapestries MUCK is a cross between a real life BDSM play party, a free form
 roleplaying environment, and a social gathering place all within a furry
 theme. It strives to provide a place for safe and free exploration of
 dominance and submission roleplay, as well as other forms of sexual
 expression in public and in private. Tapestries facilitates this by providing
 an environment that is populated exclusively by adult players and furry
 characters, as well as by setting guidelines that encourage tolerance and
 respect of other's fantasies and beliefs.

Town Center: Dragon's Way
Dragon's Way, like many of the "roads" in the area, is simply a wide footpath. It is lined by thick pine trees on either side, with brass lamp posts spaced out along it. The buildings of the local government rest in the trees to each side, as well as a smaller path that wanders around the Town Hall and to the Temple Mount to the west. The path deadends to the north in a thick forest. The grass is damp in places from the last rain shower, and there is the occasional gust of wind blowing through the trees, rustling the branches against each other. Around the clearings you see the first flowers of spring. The lamps cast pools of light, spaced just close enough together to make the area feel safe in the night with out being so bright that you can not make out the stars above.
[ Obvious Exits: Temple Mount (temp), Fox Plaza (s), Stockades (e), Homeless Shelter (ne), Town Hall (w) ]

01-31-2009: UPS AGAIN?
 
Suspecting the UPS crashed while I was asleep again. This is probably the last
straw for keeping the site where it is. Probably co-locate it somewhere soon.
