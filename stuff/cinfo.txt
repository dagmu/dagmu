> Character Info for: Dagon
Preference: ++dragons/equines/bigcats, --prey/orcs/monkeys/roo's/bears.   If you pose well (creative, readable, quick) you will gain my respect quickly.    If you're a male player with a female character, I'd like to know, if we're to play around.  http://www.f-list.net/c/dagon
Roleplay: Yesplease. Dagon has a story, but hasn't played much with it lately. I most enjoy playing little 1-2 scene stories with people, making up an interesting (usually sex based) scene to play for a night that may or may not carry on.

> This hobby has stolen a lot of my money and time and replaced them with lots of little plastic things that I enjoy painting and making fight my friends' little plastic things. I have about 3000 points of both space marines and orks, with about 1000 more of grey knights, and I have a 40k blog at http://40kay.blogspot.com/
